<h1>Case study 1</h1>
<p><i>Andr&eacute;s Navarro S.</i> </p>

<p>For case study #1 you will adopt a process similar to what has been demonstrated in class and through lab to determine the underlying causes of a particular JavaScript oddity, as evidenced by the code snippet below:</p>

<code>
<var>var message = 'foo';</var><br><br>
function printIt() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(message);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<var>var message = 'bar';</var><br>
};<br><br>
printIt();
</code>

<p>Please enter the code snippet above in to your browser console, or run it through an external .js file to see the result. In examining the code, you might expect that the result of running the printIt function would be printing either 'foo' or 'bar' to the console; however, this is not the case. It is your responsibility to determine why and to identify reputable publications or commentary online to help you explain it. </p>

<p>To complete this assignment you must:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Find at least three reputable sources online to help you explain the code snippet above (more sources are certainly acceptable).</li>
    <li>Clearly explain the code snippet above and the result in your own words and with reference to your three sources. I expect this to be clearly written and include proper references.  Your write up should be no less than 200 words, but may be up to 400.</li>
    <li>Develop a related, but distinct example demonstrating the same result, but using different code. Make sure to explain how your example is similar and how it is different from the code snippet above.</li>
</ul>
