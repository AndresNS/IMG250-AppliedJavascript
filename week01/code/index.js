                //Caveat (Advertencia): "use strict" can be used inside single functions or class bodies, but again, it must be the first thing in the body.

// npm init -f  initialize npm with default values. (Create package.json)
// npm install eslint --save-dev   (create node_modules and package-lock.json)
